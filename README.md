# TanzanianWaterProblems
## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Tanzania has issues providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000. Through a competition on DrivenData.org I have been tasked to analyze and predict which water pumps will need to be repaired in the future. Understanding what water pumps will need repairs can improve maintenace costs and time, and ensure the availability of clean water to Tanzanians.

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.
The data I am using was sourced from Taarfia and The Tanzanian Ministry of Water. Given that this data is from a competition I know that it perfectly relates to the business problem. The data gives information about the location of the water point, what type of pump is being used, how its being managed and when it was installed. Using this information I need to predict whether a pump is functional, needs some repairs or doesn't work at all.


## Methods

First to analyze I dove into looking through all the value counts for

Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
